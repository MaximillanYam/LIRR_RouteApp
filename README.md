# LIRR_RouteApp
This application takes all of the train stations on the Long Island Rail Road and allows the user to enter a station and discover the possible branches from that station.
Upon running the code, a gui should appear on the screen, the user should type in a station part of the Long Island Rail Road word for word to ensure that the code will work properly.
The Gui should then update and show the user the possible branches that stem from the station that they entered. Thank you!



NOTE - All of the xml files are needed for the application to run, as well as JavaFx will need to be installed.
